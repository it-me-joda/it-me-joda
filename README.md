## Joda Interactive

Joda Interactive is my organization for creating games and other interactive content for people to enjoy (and hopefully learn from) online. Here are a couple things you should check out!

[Space Journey](https://github.com/JodaInteractive/ldg-jam-3) - A 2d shmup where you are tasked with finding a new home for the human race. Built with Bevy.
<br/>
[Tickery Tockery: Panic at the Clockery](https://github.com/JodaInteractive/clockery) - An arcade style game where you play as Cogsworth a robot responsible for winding and keeping clocks on time.

## Open Source Contributions

I mostly contribute to things I'm using at the moment which recently has mostly been Bevy and it's ecosystem of crates

[Bevy](https://github.com/bevyengine) - Bevy is an open-source game engine written in Rust that focuses on a strong data-driven ECS model.
<br/>
[leafwing-input-manager](https://github.com/Leafwing-Studios/leafwing-input-manager) - LWIM is an Input Manager for Bevy that makes handling user inputs from any device much simpler.
<br/>
[skein](https://github.com/rust-adventure/skein) - Skein is a tool that simplifies the process of using Blender assets in a Bevy project.

I have also made a few contributions to [AWS CDK](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk) and [Go](https://github.com/golang/go) over the years.

## Professional experience

I have worked in healthcare, edtech, ecommerce, and the federal government. Primarily I have focused on building high-performance web applications in cloud environments on AWS and Azure.
